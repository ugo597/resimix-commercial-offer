README.md                       <- Must be at root
generate-resimix-offer.js       <- Must be at root
examples/                       <- Subdirectory is OK
examples/Resimix.png

examples/RESIMIX_Offerta_Template_Oct26.docx
```

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå WRONG: Nested SKILL.md
```
resimix-commercial-offer-main/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Commercial_Offer_Skill/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md              <- WRONG! Too deeply nested
```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT: SKILL.md at root
```
resimix-commercial-offer/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md                  <- CORRECT! At root level
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/
```

### ‚ùå WRONG: Downloading from main branch
The main branch still has the old structure with SKILL.md nested in `Commercial_Offer_Skill/`

### ‚úÖ CORRECT: Use this branch
Branch: `claude/fix-repository-upload-011CUXaMstch9NkyJyLa4EAs` has the correct structure

## üìù Upload Instructions

### Option 1: Use the Pre-Made ZIP (Recommended)

1. Download `resimix-commercial-offer.zip` from this repository
2. Go to https://claude.ai
3. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Features** ‚Üí **Skills**
4. Click **Upload Skill**
5. Select `resimix-commercial-offer.zip`
6. Done!

### Option 2: Create Your Own ZIP

**Only if you made changes to the files:**

```bash
# Navigate to repository root
cd /path/to/resimix-commercial-offer

# Verify SKILL.md is at root level
ls -la SKILL.md  # Should show ./SKILL.md

# Create ZIP (must be run from repository root!)
zip -r my-skill.zip SKILL.md README.md generate-resimix-offer.js examples/

# Verify ZIP contents
unzip -l my-skill.zip  # SKILL.md should be at top level, no nested folders
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Error: "SKILL.md file must be in the top-level folder"

**Cause**: You're using a ZIP where SKILL.md is nested inside a folder.

**Solution**:
1. Use the pre-made `resimix-commercial-offer.zip` from this repository
2. OR ensure you're on branch `claude/fix-repository-upload-011CUXaMstch9NkyJyLa4EAs`
3. When creating ZIP, run the command from the repository root

### Error: "unexpected key in SKILL.md frontmatter"

**Cause**: SKILL.md has invalid properties in the YAML frontmatter.

**Solution**: Current SKILL.md only uses `name` and `description` which are valid. If you modified it, ensure only these properties are used:
- name
- description
- license (optional)
- allowed-tools (optional)
- metadata (optional)

### Error: Still seeing old structure

**Cause**: Looking at the wrong branch or old cached files.

**Solution**:
1. Confirm you're on the correct branch: `git branch --show-current`
2. Pull latest changes: `git pull origin claude/fix-repository-upload-011CUXaMstch9NkyJyLa4EAs`
3. Use the ZIP file from this branch, not main branch
